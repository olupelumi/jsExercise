    <h1> Hello World</h1>
    <script src="index.js"> //src=index.js tells the browser that our javascript code is in index.js
    //want to put the script in the body section and not the head so the head doesn't take forever to process and the body will be able to actually render
            //js code at end of body section is best practice
       //we want to separate the html and javascript so things don't get all mixed up and confused
       //we can add a reference to the javascript code
